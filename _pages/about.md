I’m an interdisciplinary marine scientist specialized in the social, ecological, and policy dimensions of environmental change on marine biodiversity. My expertise focuses on the complex interplay between climate-driven shifts in migratory marine species’ habitat use and the capacity of ocean governance frameworks to respond — from coastal waters to the high seas. I also examine the social implications of changing marine resources on small-scale fisheries to support more equitable and inclusive ocean policies at local and regional scales.

In addition, I am a research collaborator with [LoggerheadSTRETCH](https://www.loggerheadstretch.org/) (“Sea Turtle Research Experiment on the Thermal Corridor Hypothesis”), investigating governance implications of climate-driven habitat shifts in sea turtles. I also contribute to [ORRAA’s Gender and Climate Change Factsheets](https://oceanrisk.earth/fact-sheets/) to highlight women’s roles in small-scale fisheries and advance gender-responsive policy development. I have co-authored over a dozen [peer-reviewed publications](/publications/) on the social, ecological, and policy aspects of marine management, am a member of the [IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management](https://iucn.org/our-union/commissions/iucn-commission-ecosystem-management-2021-2025), and am a contributing author to the transformative fisheries governance subsection of the inaugural [USGS Biodiversity and Climate Change Assessment](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/climate-adaptation-science-centers/science/biodiversity-and-climate-change-assessment).

I also worked with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop global guidelines for spatial marine management. I hold a B.S. in Marine Vertebrate Biology from Stony Brook University, an M.S. in Marine Science from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, and a Ph.D. in Environment and Resources from Stanford University.
