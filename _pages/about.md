I‚Äôm an interdisciplinary marine scientist specialized in the social, ecological, and policy dimensions of environmental change on marine biodiversity. My expertise focuses on the complex interplay between climate-driven shifts in migratory marine species‚Äô habitat use and the capacity of ocean governance frameworks to respond ‚Äî from coastal waters to the high seas. I also examine the social implications of changing marine resources on small-scale fisheries to support more equitable and inclusive ocean policies at local and regional scales.

I currently serve as the Global Ocean Program Associate at The Nature Conservancy, supporting regional ocean teams and local field programs worldwide ‚Äî 350+ staff across 50+ countries ‚Äî through fundraising, policy engagement, strategic communications, and capacity building. In addition, I am a research collaborator with [LoggerheadSTRETCH](https://www.loggerheadstretch.org/) (‚ÄúSea Turtle Research Experiment on the Thermal Corridor Hypothesis‚Äù), investigating governance implications of climate-driven habitat shifts in sea turtles, and contribute to [ORRAA‚Äôs Gender and Climate Change Factsheets](https://oceanrisk.earth/fact-sheets/) to highlight women‚Äôs roles in small-scale fisheries and advance gender-responsive policy development. I have co-authored over a dozen peer-reviewed publications on the social, ecological, and policy aspects of marine management, currently serve on the [IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management](https://iucn.org/our-union/commissions/iucn-commission-ecosystem-management-2021-2025), and am a contributing author to the transformative fisheries governance subsection of the inaugural [USGS Biodiversity and Climate Change Assessment](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/climate-adaptation-science-centers/science/biodiversity-and-climate-change-assessment).

Previously, I served as an International Activities Analyst at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as a 2018 Sea Grant Knauss Fellow, supporting U.S. ocean research priorities and international partnerships. I also worked with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop global guidelines for spatial marine management. I hold a B.S. in Marine Vertebrate Biology from Stony Brook University, an M.S. in Marine Science from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, and a Ph.D. in Environment and Resources from Stanford University.
