## Science-Policy Engagements
<hr />

I am deeply committed to research that not only advances scientific understanding, but also generates actionable insights to inform and influence policy decisions. My goal is to guide decision-makers toward sustainable and adaptive ocean management strategies grounded in rigorous science. By bridging research and practical policy applications, I strive to ensure that ocean science contributes to real-world impact and drives tangible conservation outcomes.

To this end, I’ve contributed in various capacities to several high-level international science-policy forums, ...including the [2025 Our Ocean Conference](https://ourocean2025.kr), [2025 UN Ocean Conference](https://unocnice2025.org/en/), [28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP28)](https://unfccc.int/cop28), and the [2018 Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group](https://www.imf.org/external/spring/2018/).
