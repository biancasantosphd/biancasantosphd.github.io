My research explores how anthropogenic and environmental pressures affect marine biodiversity, ocean governance, and coastal communities. I integrate natural and social science approaches to inform adaptive, inclusive, and scalable strategies for managing marine ecosystems from coastal waters to the high seas. Spanning global to local scales, my work draws on methods such as policy analysis, spatial modeling, and stakeholder surveys to support effective ocean governance.

My research can loosely be grouped into three core areas:

## (1) High seas biodiversity governance

This area explores the complex challenges of conserving marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions, where fragmented governance frameworks have historically limited effective protection. It focuses on evolving international efforts to establish equitable, comprehensive agreements—such as the recent BBNJ (or “High Seas”) treaty—that aim to sustainably manage marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. A key interest lies in understanding how fisheries and biodiversity policies and regulations across national and regional boundaries interact to influence the conservation of highly migratory species, and how these frameworks might be improved through collaborative governance.

## (2) Climate-driven shifts of migratory species

The mobile nature of migratory marine species across jurisdictional boundaries poses significant challenges for biodiversity management, especially under global environmental change. Climate-driven habitat shifts may alter species’ distributions across geopolitical boundaries, raising complex governance issues in a physically borderless yet legally bounded ocean. This area of research focuses on understanding these dynamic species redistributions through ecological and spatial modeling, assessing governance frameworks’ capacity to respond to transboundary shifts, and informing adaptive, collaborative management approaches that can accommodate rapidly changing ocean ecosystems.

## (3) Social-ecological dynamics of small-scale fisheries

</figure>This area explores the complex challenges faced by coastal communities, especially small-scale fisheries, as they navigate the impacts of climate change on their livelihoods, food security, and cultural practices. It emphasizes the need for locally grounded, mixed-methods research that integrates social and ecological perspectives to better understand how environmental stressors affect fishing activity, biodiversity, and  adaptive capacity. This research also considers how gender and intersecting social identities influence resilience and adaptive capacity, contributing to the development of inclusive, equitable, and gender-responsive management strategies.
