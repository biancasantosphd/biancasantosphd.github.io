My research explores how anthropogenic and environmental pressures affect marine biodiversity, ocean governance, and coastal communities. I integrate natural and social science approaches to inform adaptive, inclusive, and scalable strategies for managing marine ecosystems from coastal waters to the high seas. Spanning global to local scales, my work draws on methods such as policy analysis, spatial modeling, and stakeholder surveys to support effective ocean governance.

My research can loosely be divided into three core areas:

# (1) High seas biodiversity governance
This area of research explores the complex challenges of conserving marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions, where fragmented governance frameworks have historically limited effective protection. It focuses on the evolving international efforts to establish equitable, comprehensive agreements—such as the recent BBNJ treaty—that address ecological, economic, and diplomatic dimensions of high seas management. A key interest lies in understanding how fisheries policies and regulations across national and regional boundaries interact to influence the conservation of highly migratory species and how these frameworks might be improved through collaborative governance.

# (2) Climate-driven shifts of migratory species
My research in this space integrates ecological and spatial modeling to understand how migratory marine species shift their habitats in response to climate change, and how these shifts affect species distributions across political boundaries. This work includes evaluating existing governance frameworks and their capacity to adapt to transboundary changes, both within and beyond national jurisdictions. As part of collaborative efforts with LoggerheadSTRETCH, which investigates anticipated changes in sea turtle habitat use and movement patterns under warming oceanographic conditions, my work concentrates on the governance complexities arising from climate-driven species redistributions and the implications for adaptive management strategies.
