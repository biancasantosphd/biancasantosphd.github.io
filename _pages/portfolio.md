My research explores how anthropogenic and environmental pressures affect marine biodiversity, ocean governance, and coastal communities. I integrate natural and social science approaches to inform adaptive, inclusive, and scalable strategies for managing marine ecosystems from coastal waters to the high seas. Spanning global to local scales, my work draws on methods such as policy analysis, spatial modeling, and stakeholder surveys to support effective ocean governance.

My research can loosely be divided into three core areas:

# (1) High seas biodiversity governance
This area of research explores the complex challenges of conserving marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions, where fragmented governance frameworks have historically limited effective protection. It focuses on the evolving international efforts to establish equitable, comprehensive agreements—such as the recent BBNJ treaty—that address ecological, economic, and diplomatic dimensions of high seas management. A key interest lies in understanding how fisheries policies and regulations across national and regional boundaries interact to influence the conservation of highly migratory species and how these frameworks might be improved through collaborative governance.
