My research expertise lies in understanding how anthropogenic and environmental pressures affect marine biodiversity, ocean governance, and coastal communities. I bring an interdisciplinary perspective that integrates natural and social science approaches to inform adaptive, inclusive, and scalable strategies for managing marine ecosystems — from coastal waters to the high seas. Spanning global to local contexts, my work has employed methods including policy analysis, spatial modeling, and stakeholder surveys to support more holistic, ecosystem-based management. This expertise loosely centers on three core areas:

## (1) High seas biodiversity governance

This area focuses on the complex challenges of conserving marine biodiversity both across and beyond national jurisdictions, where fragmented governance frameworks have historically limited effective protection. It encompasses efforts such as the recent Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) treaty — also known as the “High Seas” treaty — which seeks to sustainably manage marine life in areas beyond national jurisdiction. My expertise includes examining how fisheries and biodiversity policies across scales interact to shape conservation outcomes, and how these frameworks can better support the protection of marine biodiversity.

The mobile nature of migratory marine species across jurisdictional boundaries poses significant challenges for biodiversity management, especially under global environmental change. Climate-driven habitat shifts may alter species’ distributions across geopolitical boundaries, raising complex governance issues in a physically borderless yet legally bounded ocean. My expertise focuses on understanding these habitat redistributions through ecological and spatial modeling, assessing governance frameworks’ capacity to respond to transboundary shifts, and informing adaptive, collaborative management approaches that can accommodate rapidly changing ocean ecosystems.

  This area explores the complex challenges faced by coastal communities - particularly small-scale fisheries - as they navigate the impacts of climate change on their livelihoods, food security, and cultural practices. It highlights the importance of locally grounded, mixed-methods research that integrates social and ecological perspectives to understand how environmental stressors influence fishing activity, biodiversity, and adaptive capacity. My expertise also encompasses how gender and other social identities influence resilience and adaptive capacity, contributing to the development of inclusive, equitable, and gender-responsive management strategies.
