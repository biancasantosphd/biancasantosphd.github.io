My research expertise lies in understanding how anthropogenic and environmental pressures affect marine biodiversity, ocean governance, and coastal communities. I bring an interdisciplinary perspective that integrates natural and social science approaches to inform adaptive, inclusive, and scalable strategies for managing marine ecosystems — from coastal waters to the high seas. Spanning global to local contexts, my work has employed methods including policy analysis, spatial modeling, and stakeholder surveys to support more holistic, ecosystem-based management. This expertise loosely centers on three core areas:

## (1) High seas biodiversity governance

The effective conservation of marine biodiversity across and beyond national jurisdictions remains a major global challenge, due largely to fragmented governance systems and limited legal protections in the high seas. Efforts like the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) treaty — also known as the “High Seas” treaty — represent critical steps toward more sustainable and equitable ocean governance. My expertise includes examining how fisheries and biodiversity policies interact across scales to shape conservation outcomes, and how governance frameworks can better support the protection of marine biodiversity in international waters.

The climate-driven habitat redistribution of migratory marine species across jurisdictional boundaries presents a growing challenge for the marine management. As species shift in response to changing ocean conditions, existing governance frameworks often struggle to adapt, creating gaps in protection and cooperation. My expertise includes using spatial analyses to understand how species movements are shifting across borders and assessing the ability of governance systems to respond.

Small-scale fisheries are vital to the food security, livelihoods, and cultural identity of millions of coastal communities — but they remain highly vulnerable to environmental stressors driven by climate change. These pressures can disrupt fishing activity, reduce biodiversity, and challenge communities’ ability to adapt. My expertise lies in combining social and ecological methods to better understand how climate change impacts small-scale fishing communities and their capacity to adapt. This also includes attention to how gender and other intersecting social identities shape resilience, informing more inclusive, equitable, and gender-responsive strategies for managing coastal marine resources.
